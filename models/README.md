# Models Directory

This folder holds the trained ML model and dataset for HandSignify.

## Required Files (Not in Git)

The following files are generated by training scripts and are **not** committed:

- **`model.p`** — Trained Random Forest classifier for sign detection
- **`data.pickle`** — Processed landmark data used for training

## How to Generate

1. **Collect training images** (see `scripts/collect_imgs.py` and `scripts/create_dataset.py`)
2. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_classifier.py
   ```
   This produces `models/model.p` and requires `models/data.pickle`.

## Model Details

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest (scikit-learn)
- **Input:** 42-dimensional hand landmark features from MediaPipe
- **Output:** Class labels (A–Z, Hello, Thank You, etc.)
